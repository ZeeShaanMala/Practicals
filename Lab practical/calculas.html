        <b>Calculas</b>,a branch of Mathematics, developed by <i>Newton and Leibnit</i>, deals with the study of the rate of change. Calculas define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup>
        <abbr title="Calculas Method">CM</abbr> is generally used in Mathematics models to obtain optimal solutions. <i>It helps to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function</i>.Calculas Math mainly focused on some important topics such as <b>differentiation,integration,limits,functions</b>, and so in. Scientific calculation provide 
    formula like H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.                                               </i>
